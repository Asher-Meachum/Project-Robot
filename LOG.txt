02/07/2024 When attempting the first trial, I noticed a bug that was causing only the right wheel to turn. This led to the discovery that I had forgotten to reverse the names for forward and backward and left and right.
Issues were not completely remediated. Testing will occur before major rewrite of robot_car.py.
Test was not possible due to the irregularity of outputs with the same code.
