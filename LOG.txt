When attempting the first trial, I noticed a bug that was causing only the left wheel to turn. This led to the discovery that I had forgotten to reverse the names for forward and backward and left and right.
Issues were not completely remediated. Testing will occur before major rewrite of robot_car.py. Test was not possible due to the irregularity of outputs with the same code.
Further examintation showed a misplaced pin between GPIO Pin 19 and AIN2. This did not clear up the problem; the right motor to turn.

I replaced the jumper wires connecting the right wheel to the DRV8833. After this modification, the wheel did work.

I replaced the motors, which under a quick run appeared to clear up the problem of the curved path. Further testing is needed to check to see if the distance is regular and confirm it does not follow a curved trajectory.
